If you would like to test the API quickly, we recommend using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps). To get you started faster, we have created this [collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/29db8ae7eb64f8da3c21) that you can simply import into Postman.

Note the following:

* The Postman requests are using the sandbox basic profile (on the right).
* In the card identifier request, ensure to change the authorisation value in the headers parameter to the merchant session key that is generated.
* In the transaction request, you will need to add in the merchant session key and card identifier generated as well as change the vendortxcode.
