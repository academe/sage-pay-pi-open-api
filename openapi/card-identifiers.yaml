      The card identifiers endpoint allows you to represent the card details as the `cardIdentifier` that you will then use in the transaction registration.

      The `cardIdentifier` expires after 400 seconds and is returned on the response along with the expiry and card type. You will need to retrieve the card identifier and use it in the next step to perform a transaction.

      **Authentication**: You will need to use the `merchantSessionKey` as an access token in the Authorisation request header field.

      summary: Create a new Card Identifier
      description: |
        You need to have a valid `merchantSessionKey` before you can create a `cardIdentifier`.
        
        The merchant session key expires after 400 seconds, after which is no longer be valid. It’s also one time use, which means you’ll need to generate a new `merchantSessionKey` for every `cardIdentifier`.

        The merchant session key will allow 3 failed attempts to generate a card identifier before it’s removed.

        ### Link a reusable card identifier with a security code

        If you are using a reusable card identifier and require a security code check, you will need to link the reusable card identifier with the security code.
